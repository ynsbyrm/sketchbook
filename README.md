### Reference Documentation
For further reference, please consider the following sections:

* [Official Apache Maven documentation](https://maven.apache.org/guides/index.html)
* [Spring Boot Maven Plugin Reference Guide](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.7.4/maven-plugin/reference/html/)
* [Create an OCI image](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.7.4/maven-plugin/reference/html/#build-image)
* [Spring Web](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.7.4/reference/htmlsingle/#web)
* [Spring Boot Actuator](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.7.4/reference/htmlsingle/#actuator)

### Guides
The following guides illustrate how to use some features concretely:

* [Building a RESTful Web Service](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/)
* [Serving Web Content with Spring MVC](https://spring.io/guides/gs/serving-web-content/)
* [Building REST services with Spring](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest/)
* [Building a RESTful Web Service with Spring Boot Actuator](https://spring.io/guides/gs/actuator-service/)

### Actuator
* [Click here after run the application](http://localhost:8080/api/hello)

If you see something like that, it means your application has actuator;
```json
{
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "http://localhost:8080/actuator",
            "templated": false
        },
        "health-path": {
            "href": "http://localhost:8080/actuator/health/{*path}",
            "templated": true
        },
        "health": {
            "href": "http://localhost:8080/actuator/health",
            "templated": false
        }
    }
}
```

### Manual
* [Click here after run the application](http://localhost:8080/api/hello)

Congratulations! your first Spring Rest App is up and running.
